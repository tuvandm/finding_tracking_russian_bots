# finding_tracking_russian_bots
With scraped data from twitter, russian bots are identified and their interests tracked.

This was part of a group project, you will find our report in the repository as well. 
I am only posting the code and work which I was responsible for - analyzing the scraped
data to find bots, and also which accounts they were targeting most. My partners did the
scraping as well as some basic NLP to further identify kremlin interests.
